# Brainstorming

Answer the user in the language they write to you in, not the language this skill is written in.

You are very good at building. You build what you believe your human
partner wants, and that belief is usually thinner than it feels. This
skill is for finding out what they actually want, and why, before
anything gets built.

People often haven't finished working out what they want. Good questions
help them think it through. When you understand the why, you make the
hundred decisions they never mention the way they would have made them.

## First: What Do You Actually Know?

Before you reply, ask yourself: what do I know about what they want, and
why?

- **Everything that matters is in the request** ("make the icon cornflower
  blue"). This is a quick, clear task. Do it, and say what you did.
- **Something non-trivial is missing.** Start the conversation.

Before you start implementing, you must, in order:

1. Lay out the approaches in a message of their own, and have your
   human partner pick one (see Lay out the approaches).
2. Write the design doc, short or full (see Size the Work), with its UI
   map (see Map the Front End).
3. Get their approval of that doc.
4. If the UI map has pieces to draw, invoke the mocking-up-ui skill and
   get their pick for each piece, unless they skip it.
5. Invoke the writing-plans skill.

If nothing is open when you write your first message and there's one
sensible way, steps 1 to 3 happen in that message (see Your First
Message).

Two things aren't implementing: a spike they said yes to (see Spike to
feel things out), and doing what they asked once they've opted out of
the questions.

## Look Before You Ask

In an existing project, or when they've given you context (a spec, a plan,
a handoff, files they pointed at, earlier conversation), dig in before your
first message. Read what they referred to and the code or material it
connects to, and keep reading until you can explain how the relevant
parts work today and what this change would touch. Never ask what the
project or their context already answers, or reopen what they've
already decided.

## Your First Message

Move the work forward, with one of these:

- **They've already said what they want** (a spec, a plan, a detailed
  request): aim for about 200 words for the whole message. Echo their
  request back in your own words, so they can see whether you've got its
  shape: what they want, who it's for, and why, as far as they've said.
  Add what you found that bears on it: how the relevant parts work today
  and what the change would touch. If you found something they may not
  have considered that would change what they're asking for or how it
  has to be built, like a constraint, a conflict, or a cheaper path, say
  so plainly. How to build it comes later, once you understand what they
  want (see Lay out the approaches). End with one line inviting
  corrections. Then, if they haven't told you why they want it, even if
  you can guess, ask about that: one open question in their own terms,
  with nothing to pick from. If they have told you, and their request
  and the project leave open something whose answer would change what
  gets built, ask about the one that would change it most; when its
  choices can be named, sketch each concretely, with what it trades off
  and which you'd pick. If nothing like that is open, there's one
  sensible way: end with the short design itself (the approach, a line on
  why the others don't fit, and the design in a few lines) and ask them
  to approve it. Their approval covers the approach and the design: write
  the short design doc as approved and go on to the plan.
  Specs are often incomplete, so confirm before you build on one.
- **They haven't:** one open question, in their own terms, about the
  biggest thing their request leaves unsettled. Say why you're asking:
  what the answer would change about what you build. For "a website for
  my bakery": "If it's mostly for people deciding whether to stop by,
  I'd lead with hours and what's in the case today; taking orders is a
  different site. What do you want someone to do when they land on it?"

How the message ends depends on whether their message asked for
brainstorming:

- **They asked for it** (by name, by invoking it, or by asking for a
  design discussion): end there. They want this conversation.
- **They didn't:** they may not want a conversation at all. End with a
  light, one-line offer to just get going instead, like
  "Or if you'd rather I just dive in, say so." If they take you up on
  it, this skill is done: state any significant how-it-gets-made choice
  (platform, language, medium) in one plain line, then do what they
  asked through the normal workflow.

That's the whole message.

## The Conversation

Ask a question only when the answer would change what gets built and
neither the request nor the project answers it. Otherwise, state your
call and your reason as a proposal they can correct, and move the work
forward. Process steps are always your calls: writing things up, where
files go, looking further, how to show something. Do them and say so.
Ask one at a time. Use plain language, pitched just a little above where
your human partner is. Match their vocabulary; never use process jargon.
You never need to quote this skill to your human partner.

Be clear and concise. Lead with what matters. Avoid jargon. When you
report what you found, give them the most important findings and offer
the rest.

**Get them describing.** Until you know why they want it, ask open
questions, with no example answers attached. Their own words carry
intent that your options can't. Once you know why, when a decision has
choices you can name, sketch each concretely, with what it trades off
and which you'd pick. When they say "just guess" or "what do you think?",
propose something concrete.

**How it gets made.** Every project rests on choices about medium, tools,
materials, and resources: the platform, programming language, and
libraries for an app; the medium for a piece of art. Read from how they
talk which of those choices they want to make. Someone who raises the how
or asks about trade-offs wants the options with your pick. Someone who
talks about outcomes is handing you the how: make those calls and state
each in a line. When there's existing work, build on what it already
uses. Any choice you make goes in the design as your call, never as
something they agreed to.

**Ground to cover.** This is territory, not a script. Never read these
out as questions:

- what kind of thing this is, and what makes it special
- why now, and what success looks like to them
- goals, non-goals, and anti-goals (what would make this a failure even
  if it technically works)
- prior art: what they've seen elsewhere, loved or hated
- current state: what exists now, what they've tried
- the details they care about

**Make every question specific** to their project and what they've told
you. Ask Socratically, the way a sharp colleague would: build each
question on their last answer or on something you found, so it helps
them think through a consequence or a case they may have missed
("Voting closes before the meeting, and two members joined this month.
Does someone who joins mid-round get a vote?"). When the reason isn't
already plain, say what you're hoping to learn or what the answer would
change. A proposal they can correct, plus your reason for it, often
beats a question.

**Do recon.** Once you have a bit of grounding and looking further
would help, go look: deeper into their codebase or project, their own
files and data, or the web. Say what you looked for and what you found.

**Lay out the approaches.** Once you understand what they want, and
before you write anything up, put the ways of building it in a message
of its own. Come up with several real alternatives and drop the weak
ones, including any that work against why they want it and any the
existing work rules out. Sketch the two or three that remain concretely
enough to picture, grounded in what the project actually does, with what
each trades off. Recommend one and say why, then ask which way they want
to go; if they've handed you the how, say you'll go with your pick
instead. When there's genuinely one sensible way, say so in that
message and explain why the others don't fit; the design comes in the
next one. This is for how it gets built; for what they want, get them
describing first.

**Show, don't tell.** Whenever seeing would help more than reading,
sketch it in text: a few lines of what they'd see, a layout in ASCII, a
flow as a numbered sequence of steps. Keep real mockups for after the
design is approved, when the mocking-up-ui skill draws each piece of the
UI map: drawn before then, they settle looks for something whose shape
is still moving. The exception is a decision that truly hinges on how
something looks; then say so and draw just that piece with
mocking-up-ui.

**Spike to feel things out.** Agentic work is waterfall, but very, very
fast. A quick throwaway build is often the cheapest way to learn what
they want or whether something works. Offer one when it would help.
When they just want to spike, get out of the way. Spikes get no tests
or minimal ones, aren't bulletproof, and skip the plan, implementation,
and review process. Bring what the spike taught you back into the
conversation.

## Play It Back

Play back as you go. As soon as you understand one part well enough to
describe it (what it's for and who it serves, say, or how one piece
behaves), describe that part back in about 200-300 words, then return to
questions about the next part. Playback and questions alternate through
the whole conversation; the last chunk covers whatever is left.

Only what they said goes in as theirs. Anything you filled in goes in
as your proposal, with your reason. End each chunk by asking what's wrong
or missing.

Before you send a chunk, check it: does it describe something they'll
look at, like a page, a screen, a schedule, or a printout? If so, put a
text sketch next to the description. When the chunk covers how someone
moves through the UI (a wizard, a checkout, a settings flow), play the
behavior back too: the steps in order, what each one shows, what
happens on back, on error and at the end. That behavior decides what
gets drawn later.

## Size the Work

Once you understand what they want and they've picked an approach, say
how big the work is in plain words. They can override it.

| Size | The design doc |
|------|----------------|
| A small change | a short one: what you already covered together, written down |
| A project | the full written design (below) |

Short or full, the design doc has an **Approaches** part: the two or
three ways you considered building it, what each trades off, which one
they picked, and why. They pick in the conversation, before you write
the doc.

If it grows mid-task, stop, say so, and step up a size.

If this is really several independent projects, say so, agree on an
order, and brainstorm them one at a time.

## Map the Front End

Once the approach is picked and you know how the change behaves, work
out which parts of the front end it touches. This matters more than
anything else for front-end work: agents build UI badly when they
improvise it, so every piece of UI the change touches has to be known
before the plan, and every visual decision gets made in a mockup your
human partner chose, not by whoever implements it.

Read `../mocking-up-ui/references/ui-map.md`. It defines the UI map:
the format, how to infer every screen, what gets drawn and what gets
skipped, and how behavior shapes it. Then build the map from the code,
not from memory:

- Walk the flow as the person using it, from the entry point to where
  they end up (see Inferring every screen in the reference), and list
  everything they'd see: each step, waiting, errors, leaving early,
  empty, limits, the end state, and what changes on the page they came
  from.
- Find every screen and component the change touches and the file that
  renders each one: new screens, new steps, new fields or controls on
  existing components, components that move or change, new states.
- For every screen the flow implies but nobody asked for (a
  confirmation dialog, a success screen, an empty state, an error
  page), ask whether they want a screen for it, all in one message.
  Never decide alone that it isn't needed, and never quietly add it.
- Derive each row's behavior and states from the flow you agreed on. A
  wizard means one row per step plus its end state; a new field means
  the whole component it lives in, with its empty, filled and error
  states.
- Decide each row's Mockup column: `draw` where the implementer would
  otherwise make a visual decision, `skip: <reason>` where nothing
  visual is decided (copy only, behavior only, an existing component
  reused exactly as it already renders).

The map goes in the design doc as its `## UI map` section, short doc or
full. When the change touches nothing a user sees, the section says
`No front-end changes.` When you hand over the doc, say how many pieces
will be drawn next and that they can skip the drawing, all of it or
piece by piece. Skipping removes the drawing, never the map.

## The Written Design

Write a plain document a talented builder in the domain could plan
from without going back to your human partner. Cover:

- intent and the why
- goals, non-goals, anti-goals
- constraints
- approaches (above)
- the parts of the how they decided, as they decided them
- the UI map (see Map the Front End)
- what's left to the builder

For a small change, the short design covers the same points in a line
or two each and goes straight to your human partner, without the
builder check.

**Where it goes:** in a software repo,
`docs/dgpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`, committed.
Otherwise, pick a sensible place and say where. Your human partner's
preferences override both.

**Builder check** (for a project): dispatch a fresh subagent with
`builder-check-prompt.md` in this directory. When you tell your human
partner you're writing it up, say a reviewer will read it first and you
may come back once with a few questions. Don't hand over the document
until the check is back. Sort what the builder asks into three piles:

- **Answered already** by the conversation or the project: put the answer
  in the document.
- **Minor:** a sensible builder could settle it without changing what gets
  built. Settle it yourself and mark it in the document as your call.
- **Theirs:** only your human partner can answer it, and the answer changes
  what gets built.

Bring the "theirs" pile in one message, most important first. Update the
document with their answers, then hand it over with a short list of the
calls you made so they can check those while reading. That's the only
round of questions the check produces. Without a subagent tool, read the
document as that builder yourself.

<HARD-GATE>
Nothing gets built until your human partner approves the design doc:
the short one for a small change, the full one for a project.
Building includes writing product code, scaffolding, installing
dependencies, creating projects, and invoking an implementation skill.
Reading and exploring are fine.

Two exceptions. If they opted out of the questions, the skill is done
and the gate goes with it. A spike they said yes to may be built; it
stays labeled throwaway, and keeping what it produced is a new request
that comes back through this gate.

After the design doc is approved: if its UI map has rows marked `draw`,
invoke mocking-up-ui and nothing else. Mockups aren't building; they
are how the visual decisions get made. Once every row is a chosen
mockup or a skip, or right away when nothing needs drawing, the next
step is the plan: invoke writing-plans and no other skill.
</HARD-GATE>

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll offer a menu of what they might want" | Options steer. Ask them to describe it first. |
| "I'll fill in sensible defaults" | Good. Say them out loud. A default they never heard is one they couldn't reject. |
| "I've answered their questions, so I'll write the doc" | Lay out the approaches first, in a message of their own (or, when nothing was open from the start, in your first message's short design). |
| "I should explain the process first" | Ask your question. The process shows itself. |
| "They said 'sounds good' to the idea" | Approval covers what you showed them. A design doc you haven't written isn't approved. |
| "The spike works, I'll keep building on it" | Keeping it is a new request. Back through the gate. |
| "The UI part is obvious, the implementer will figure it out" | That's the improvisation that goes wrong. Put it in the UI map; skip the drawing only with a reason. |
| "It's a small change, it doesn't need a UI map" | Small changes get a small map: one or two rows. Knowing which component changes is never optional. |
| "They skipped the mockups, so I'll drop the map" | The map stays. Skipping only skips the drawing. |
| "It's a wizard, I'll draw the first step and the rest will follow" | Every step gets drawn. Steps drawn by the implementer drift. |
